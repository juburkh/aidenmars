  <p>The boy sat cross-legged in the alley, his fingers buried in the wet paper of a ruined newspaper. Rain soaked the collar of his shirt and ran in beads down his spine. He didn’t move. Not when the copper footsteps stopped behind him.</p>

  <p>“You’re out late,” the man said.</p>

  <p>The boy looked up. The man’s pants were patched at the knees and his shirt hung open over a nest of wiry hair. His breath smelled like meat. Old meat. Salted. The boy flinched when he smiled—teeth the same gray as the sky.</p>

  <p>“I live here,” the boy said.</p>

  <p>“That so?” The man crouched. He was pale and wet too, but didn’t seem to feel it. “I used to sleep in alleys. Then I found a job. You like work?”</p>

  <p>The boy’s throat jumped. He didn’t nod. Didn’t shake his head either.</p>

  <p>The man reached into his coat. The fabric wrinkled with metal underneath—little clicking sounds, like bones made of spoons. He brought out a tin. Opened it.</p>

  <p>The boy leaned back, instinct sharper than thought.</p>

  <p>Inside were wires. Rusted, knotted lengths bent into shapes—figures. A woman with no hands. A man with needles down his spine. A dog, its legs made of nails. The boy saw them and thought of pain but didn’t know why.</p>

  <p>“I make people,” the man said. “Used to make them out of real things. Then people stopped letting me.”</p>

  <p>He took out a wire, coiled in a tight spiral. “This one’s you.”</p>

  <p>“I don’t want it,” the boy whispered.</p>

  <p>“Oh, you’ll take it.” The man stood, the wire still pinched between blackened fingers. “You’ll take it and come with me. Because if you don’t—well. I get ideas.”</p>

  <p>The boy ran.</p>

  <p>Not far. The alley curved, ended in a gate welded shut. He pressed his palms to the bars, kicked them, made the kind of noise only kids make when they know something’s truly wrong.</p>

  <p>The man walked.</p>

  <p>Didn’t hurry.</p>

  <p>The boy turned.</p>

  <p>“I made a boy once,” the man said. “Used to scream every night, but his tongue came off and then he was quiet. Like this alley. Like the dark.”</p>

  <p>He dropped the spiral wire on the concrete. It bounced once. The boy stared at it.</p>

  <p>The man opened his coat.</p>

  <p>Not to hurt. To show.</p>

  <p>Wires. Dozens. Maybe hundreds. Stuck in him. Some half-pulled out. Some buried to the hilt. Bent nails. Needles. Hooks. A coil in the place of one nipple. A row of teeth threaded on a filament, looped across his ribs.</p>

  <p>“I put them in myself. You can’t imagine the things you learn doing that.”</p>

  <p>The boy couldn’t breathe. Not because he was scared. He’d stopped knowing what scared meant.</p>

  <p>The man touched the top of the boy’s head. Gentle, like a priest.</p>

  <p>“Tell me your name.”</p>

  <p>The boy didn’t answer.</p>

  <p>The wire man bent down and picked up the coil.</p>

  <p>“No matter,” he said. “I’ll name you.”</p>
