    <p><em>The town’s last phone booth stood like a relic in a dust-clogged field behind the defunct gas station.</em> No phone book. No dial tone. Just glass streaked with sun-rot and someone’s greasy handprint on the inside.</p>

  <p>Mason, a 19-year-old community college dropout, discovered it by accident while looking for a place to piss after a late-night drive. The desert air smelled of scorched rubber and dry iron. Even the moon looked exhausted.</p>

  <p>He opened the booth. Dust curled out like breath. The phone, weirdly, was intact. Cord tangled. Cracked receiver. But it was there.</p>

  <p>And it rang.</p>

  <p>He stared at it, gooseflesh rising under his flannel. Who was calling a dead booth?</p>

  <p>It rang again.</p>

  <p>He picked it up.</p>

  <p>Static.</p>

  <p>Then: “Don’t come home.”</p>

  <p>He pulled the phone away, stared at it like it had teeth. His heart hiccupped in his chest. Then, a voice—his own—came through the line, trembling.</p>

  <p>“They got me. Or… will get me. Shit. This is hard to explain.”</p>

  <p>Mason laughed, half-hollow. “Okay. Who is this?”</p>

  <p>“It’s you. But not yet. Listen to me. You die tonight. Around 3:17 a.m. Gasoline. Screaming. Bones snapping. I thought maybe this would change something. Maybe if I warned myself—”</p>

  <p><strong>Click.</strong></p>

  <p>The line went dead.</p>

  <p>He drove home anyway.</p>

  <p>By 2:41 a.m., Mason had convinced himself it was a prank. That it was his buddy Tyler screwing with him. He even laughed about it during a snack break, scrolling through Reddit and thinking how viral the story might’ve been if he’d filmed it.</p>

  <p>At 3:10 a.m., someone knocked on the front door.</p>

  <p>Hard. Frantic.</p>

  <p>He opened it. No one there.</p>

  <p>Except the smell.</p>

  <p>Gasoline.</p>

  <p>His living room light blinked. Once. Twice. Then failed.</p>

  <p>The house groaned.</p>

  <p>He turned to run.</p>

  <p>The phone in his pocket—silent all night—buzzed.</p>

  <p><strong>Caller ID:</strong> Unknown</p>

  <p>He answered.</p>

  <p>His own voice, whispering: “You didn’t listen.”</p>

  <p>Then the window shattered.</p>
