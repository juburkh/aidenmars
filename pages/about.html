      <h2>Who is Aiden Mars?</h2>
      <img src="../images/profile.jpg" alt="Aiden Mars Author Photo" class="author-photo" />
      <p>
        Born and raised amid the quiet fields and four-season skies of central Indiana, Aiden Mars grew up with his nose buried in books—chapter books by first grade, full-on genre escapes by middle school. Storytelling has been a lifelong instinct, not just a craft. Today, Aiden writes with the same sense of wonder that first pulled him into the pages of his favorite childhood novels.
      </p>
      <p>
        When not building new worlds or chasing tangled characters through their darkest moments, Aiden is a devoted creature dad to six—four dogs, two cats—and a husband since 2022. He's rarely without a story in progress (or three), and believes deeply in writing as both discipline and escape.
      </p>
      <p>
        His downtime is split between screenwriting-inspired binge sessions—favorites include <em>Supernatural</em>, <em>The Sopranos</em>, <em>911</em>, <em>Young Sheldon</em>, and <em>7th Heaven</em>—and his growing pursuit of video game design and software development, much of it self-taught. He’s also pursuing his degree through Western Governors University.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aiden’s fiction often blends the emotional rawness of everyday life with the extraordinary—grounded in human feeling, even when the world tilts toward the unreal. Whether writing speculative fiction, quiet horror, or grounded drama, he writes from the gut: flawed characters, messy truths, and the kind of stories that refuse to leave quietly.
