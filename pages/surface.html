  <p>Everyone clapped when I said today was the day. Daddy called it bravery. Mom kissed my hair, said I’d earned my popsicle already.</p>

  <p>The deep end was darker. Not like the sparkly parts where light bounced back. It looked like a mirror you could fall through. Cold, even before I jumped.</p>

  <p>I told myself to do it quick. Just one big splash.</p>

  <p>So I jumped.</p>

  <p>I remember the whoosh in my ears. My swimsuit stuck to my skin. The water folded over me and the whole world blinked blue.</p>

  <p>I kicked hard, like Daddy showed me. My arms sliced up. My nose burned from the chlorine. I could see the top—like wrinkled glass above my head—but it wasn’t getting closer.</p>

  <p>I kicked again. Harder. My chest started to pinch. But when I reached up, the surface felt… different. Like saran wrap. I touched it, and it jiggled but didn’t break.</p>

  <p>I pressed harder. Scraped at it with my nails. My bubbles hit it and slid sideways.</p>

  <p>I could see them—Mom, Daddy, the lifeguard in red—blurred through the shimmer. They looked like fish behind a screen. I opened my mouth but only got water.</p>

  <p>I banged on the top. My hands slapped it. No sound. Only my heartbeat clanging in my ears.</p>

  <p>Then… something touched my foot.</p>

  <p>I thought maybe the drain was sucking me. But it was soft. Then another touch—higher, along my leg.</p>

  <p>Hands.</p>

  <p>Not grabbing. Just… patting.</p>

  <p>When I turned, I saw her.</p>

  <p>A girl my size. Hair floated around her like seaweed. Her eyes were wide but not afraid. She didn’t blink. Just stared.</p>

  <p>She reached out and took my hand. Her fingers felt rubbery, not warm. When I tried to pull away, she held tighter.</p>

  <p>She opened her mouth, but no bubbles came out.</p>

  <p>Just black.</p>

  <p>Like ink.</p>

  <p>I shook my head. Kicked again. Hit the surface with both fists. It wobbled. Didn’t break.</p>

  <p>I could still see the sun above, but it was smaller now.</p>

  <p>When I looked back, more kids were down there. Some big, some small. All staring. All quiet. One floated upside down, like she forgot which way was up. One had a balloon, but it didn’t rise.</p>

  <p>The first girl tugged my arm gently. Then again. They wanted me to stop trying.</p>

  <p>They weren’t mean. Just tired.</p>

  <p>I tried screaming. Nothing came out but bubbles.</p>

  <p>I started to forget what air tasted like.</p>

  <p>They circled me, not tight, not touching anymore. Just waiting.</p>

  <p>Maybe I’d just rest.</p>

  <p>Just for a second.</p>

  <p>I blinked, and everything above looked farther away.</p>

  <p>No more splashes. No more clapping.</p>

  <p>Only the deep, and the hands, and the slow, slow sinking.</p>
