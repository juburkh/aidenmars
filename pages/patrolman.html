    <p>The streetlight flickered, casting nervous shadows on the curb.</p>

  <p>Lena zipped her jacket higher, regretting the after-hours coffee with friends. It was late. Too late. And the bus hadn’t come.</p>

  <p>Then came the hum of tires. A patrol car. It rolled to a stop beside her, window sliding down with a mechanical sigh.</p>

  <p>“You shouldn’t be out alone,” the officer said. His face was pale in the dash glow. Calm. Kind, even. “Hop in. I’ll drive you.”</p>

  <p>She hesitated.</p>

  <p>“You don’t trust the police?” he asked, smiling.</p>

  <p>That smile—that was the mistake. It was too polished. Too deliberate. But it was cold, and her phone was dead, and the road stretched into darkness.</p>

  <p>The door clicked open.</p>

  <p>He didn’t speak as they drove. No radio chatter. No engine noise, really—just the sound of gravel under tires and Lena’s breath tightening.</p>

  <p>“Where are we going?” she asked.</p>

  <p>He didn’t answer.</p>

  <p>Instead, he turned down a narrow road lined with skeletal birch trees. The branches scraped the windshield like fingernails. Her mouth went dry.</p>

  <p>“I—I live the other way.”</p>

  <p>The car stopped.</p>

  <p>He turned slowly, and the smile was gone.</p>

  <p>“Girls like you,” he said softly, “never learn.”</p>

  <p>She reached for the door handle.</p>

  <p>It was locked.</p>

  <p><em>Later, they would find the patrol car abandoned in a ravine.</em></p>

  <p><em>The badge had been stolen.</em></p>

  <p><em>The man driving it hadn’t been a cop for over a decade.</em></p>

  <p><em>Just someone who still wore the uniform.</em></p>
