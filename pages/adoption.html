      <p>I got my adoption papers signed. Now they are on their way to take me to my new home.</p>

  <p>I press my face against the frosted window of the orphanage, watching the car glide through the dense fog toward the gates. It’s sleek and black, its headlights dimmer than they should be, their glow swallowed by the gloom.</p>

  <p>The other children don’t say goodbye. They’ve been quieter than usual, their faces pale and drawn. Some look at me, then quickly away, as if they know something they can’t bring themselves to share.</p>

  <p>The man and woman step out of the car. Both are dressed impeccably, their smiles carved too wide, their movements too fluid. Their eyes catch mine through the glass, and my stomach twists. They aren’t strangers. I’ve seen them before—in dreams that leave my sheets soaked in sweat.</p>

  <p>"Ready, Daniel?" Mrs. Carruthers asks from behind me. She’s the headmistress, her usual stern demeanor softened for the first time since I arrived here. She rests a hand on my shoulder, but it feels colder than it should. "They’re eager to meet you."</p>

  <p>I want to tell her I’ve changed my mind. I don’t want to go. But I nod, because it’s what’s expected of me.</p>

  <p>The couple’s hands are cool when they clasp mine. The woman’s fingers linger just a second too long. Her touch prickles like static, and her smile widens when I flinch.</p>

  <p>“You’ll love it with us,” she coos, her voice dripping with unnatural sweetness. “We’ve prepared the perfect room for you.”</p>

  <p>The car smells of lavender and decay. The scent clings to my throat as we glide through the mist-shrouded countryside. Every bump in the road makes my stomach churn.</p>

  <p>When we arrive, their house looms like a broken jaw against the horizon, its jagged spires stabbing at the sky.</p>

  <p>Inside, the walls seem to move, faint whispers sliding along the shadows. The couple leads me to my room—a cavernous space with no windows and a single flickering bulb. The bed is enormous, its canopy shrouded in tattered curtains that sway though there’s no breeze.</p>

  <p>“Sleep well, Daniel,” the man says, his teeth too sharp, his eyes too bright. “Tomorrow, you’ll meet the rest of the family.”</p>

  <p>I don’t sleep. I lie awake, staring at the cracks in the ceiling that form shapes I can’t describe. Somewhere in the house, a door creaks open. Footsteps echo, slow and deliberate, drawing closer.</p>

  <p>And then, from just beyond the door, a voice:</p>

  <p>“We’ve waited so long for you.”</p>
